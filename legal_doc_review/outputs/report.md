CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

This Confidentiality Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into between Company A and Company B. 1. Termination: Either party may terminate this Agreement upon 30 days' written notice. 2. Payment Terms: Payment shall be made within 45 days of invoice receipt. 3. Confidentiality: Parties agree to protect confidential information for 3 years after termination. 4. Indemnity: Each party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the other from damages. 5. Limitation of Liability: Neither party shall be liable for indirect or consequential damages.

The key obligations, deadlines, risks, and critical terms of this agreement include:

* Termination: Either party can end the agreement with 30 days' written notice.
* Payment Terms: Payments are due within 45 days of receiving an invoice.
* Confidentiality: Parties must protect confidential information for three years after termination.
* Indemnity: Each party will defend and indemnify the other against damages.
* Limitation of Liability: Neither party is responsible for indirect or consequential damages.

The agreement includes several risks, including:

* Termination Clause: Unclear what constitutes a material breach, leaving room for interpretation and potential disputes.
* Payment Terms Clause: Clear and specific, reducing the risk of delays or non-payment.
* Confidentiality Clause: Protects information for only three years after termination, with potential gaps in protection post-termination.
* Indemnity Clause: Provides broad protection but lacks clarity on types of damages covered and dispute resolution procedures.
* Limitation of Liability Clause: Excludes indirect or consequential damages, potentially leaving parties exposed to full extent of losses.

To mitigate these risks, it is recommended to consider adding a dispute resolution clause, including a broader definition of confidential information, extending the confidentiality protection period, clarifying the indemnity clause, and specifying types of damages covered.
