To update the termination clause to reflect a 60-day notice period, we need to modify line 1 of the contract.

The updated contract is as follows:

CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

This Confidentiality Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into between Company A and Company B.

1. Termination: Either party may terminate this Agreement upon 60 days' written notice.
2. Payment Terms: Payment shall be made within 45 days of invoice receipt.
3. Confidentiality: Parties agree to protect confidential information for 3 years after termination.
4. Indemnity: Each party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the other from damages.
5. Limitation of Liability: Neither party shall be liable for indirect or consequential damages.

Signed: April 10, 2025.
