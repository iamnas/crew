To update the contract to extend termination to 60 days, we can modify clause 1 as follows:

1. Termination: Either party may terminate this Agreement upon 60 days' written notice.

The rest of the contract remains unchanged. Therefore, the full updated contract text is:

CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

This Confidentiality Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into between Company A and Company B.

1. Termination: Either party may terminate this Agreement upon 60 days' written notice.
2. Payment Terms: Payment shall be made within 45 days of invoice receipt.
3. Confidentiality: Parties agree to protect confidential information for 3 years after termination.
4. Indemnity: Each party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the other from damages.
